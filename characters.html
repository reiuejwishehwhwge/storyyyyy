    <h1><b> Story Characters </b></h1>
    <p> <b>The story revolves around three pigs, but we also have an antagonist, the wolf, who symbolises life’s challenges, negativity, and hardships. Every character has its trait. The first two pigs showcase the shortcomings of lazy behaviour and an ‘I don’t care’ attitude. In contrast, the third pig establishes the positive side of being a hard worker and a planner in life. </b></p>
